## About

CyberWatchAI is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform created using a combination of TensorFlow & SciPy to identify & tag malicious traffic on a network. It uses an SVM classifier & an algorithm based on a modified Nave Bayes to identify anomalies. It also utilises a rule-based ML approach to flag & alert suspicious behaviour.

This project was created as a prototype for corporations and individuals who want to contribute as I come up with many ideas and may not have the time to work on this specific project everyday. CyberWatchAI is a combination of two words: Cyber and Watch. Cyber refers to cybersecurity, and Watch refers to the idea of monitoring or watching a network.

## Goals

- Create a comprehensive AI-powered cybersecurity platform
- Utilise TensorFlow & SciPy to identify & tag malicious traffic
- Develop an SVM classifier & an algorithm based on a modified Nave Bayes to identify anomalies
- Use a rule-based ML approach to flag & alert suspicious behaviour
- Create an easy-to-use platform for both corporations and individuals

## Roadmap

- [x] Develop a prototype
- [ ] Develop an SVM classifier & an algorithm based on a modified Nave Bayes to identify anomalies
- [ ] Utilise a rule-based ML approach to flag & alert suspicious behaviour
- [ ] Create an easy-to-use platform for both corporations and individuals
- [ ] Add more features to the platform
- [ ] Create a production-ready version

## Technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Installation

This is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on your own machine. URLs and possible keys may need to be updated as well.

## Usage

This is a work in progress and as of now it should be built off and extended to become more powerful.

## Contributing

Any APIs used are closed source and a work in progress and likely will not be released to public due to licensing agreements. Therefore, someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.
